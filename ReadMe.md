<h2>Once the repository has been cloned</h2>
<li>Navigate to the Secrets tab</li>
<li>Create a secret named <code>TOKEN</code> and give it the value of your actual bot token</li>
<li>Create another secret named <code>ApiKey</code>and give it the value of your OpenAI <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key">Api Key</a></li>
<li>Create another secret named <code>CHANNELS</code> and set the value to be the <a href="https://turbofuture.com/internet/Discord-Channel-ID">Channel ID</a> of the channel you wish the bot to speak in.</li>
<li>Create a final secret named <code>IGNORE_PREFIX</code> and this value when put in front of a sentence will tell the bot to ignore the message.</li>
<li>Hit the run button on top of the repl's page, and you should be told that <code>Your Bot's Name</code> is online.</li>

<blockquote><h1>Want free hosting?</h1></blockquote>
<li>Well if you thought free hosting existed then we highly suggest you learn the principle of <a href="https://www.cyberdefinitions.com/definitions/TINSTAFL.html">TINSTAFL</a> as it might be greatly beneficial to you.</li>
<li>Since we are not total monsters, we will provide some resources that are relatively cheap for small scale bots.</li>

<h2><img src="https://www.icegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/icegif-741.gif" width="30px"> | Sites dedicated to <strong>only</strong> hosting Discord Bots for "free"</h2>
<li><b><a href="https://bot-hosting.net">Bot-Hosting.net</a></b>: Bot-hosting.net is a relatively "free" Discord Bot hosting website. But it comes with a catch. For every one free week of bot hosting, you must earn ten points. To achieve these points, you need to do ten captchas for ten points. This may take about 5 minutes per week.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://solarhosting.cc">Solarhosting.cc</a></b>: Solarhosting.cc is a completely free Discord Bot hosting website. However it comes with two really bad catches. Firstly they have alot of downtime, like 60% of the time your bot will be offline because of website downtime. Also their support server and staff absolutely suck.</li>

<h2><img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/lPuW5AlR9AeWzSsIqi/200w.gif" width="30px"> | Virtual Private Servers (vps), you basically pay for a server to run stuff.</h2>
<li><b><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a></b>: Heroku is one of the first cloud platforms and it supports a wide range of languages. With a credit card added you can host your bot for free for 22 days and it will be relatively cheap after the 22 days.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a></b>: Amazon Web Services is another cheap cloud platform that is incredibly powerful. It has a super cool <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/?aws-products-pricing.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-pricing.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Type=*all&awsf.tech-category=*all">pay-as-you-go</a> service which is similar to utilities as you pay for what you use. It does require knowledge of Linux and can cost anywhere from 8.50 to 20 based on how many people use your bot.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a></b>: This by far the best one and the one we recommend to you. Also any affiliate link should give you $100 in credit for up to 60 days. This also requires some knowledge of Linux as it is just a VPS, however I find the UI much easier to work with than AWS. Compared to AWS the clear downside is the free credit offer only lasts 60 days instead of 1 year. After that their cheapest plan is $5 a month</li>
