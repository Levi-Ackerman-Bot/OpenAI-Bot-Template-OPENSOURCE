## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

At Levi Ackerman Website, we take security vulnerabilities seriously and strive to ensure the safety and integrity of our platform. If you discover a security issue that could potentially compromise the security or privacy of our users, we encourage you to responsibly disclose it to us.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

When reporting security vulnerabilities, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensure that all communications regarding the vulnerability are kept confidential between you and the Levi Ackerman Website security team. Do not disclose any details of the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved.

2. **Provide Details**: When reporting a vulnerability, please provide detailed information about the issue, including steps to reproduce it and any potential impact it may have.

3. **Responsible Testing**: Please refrain from performing any actions that could harm the integrity or availability of our platform. Only test for vulnerabilities on accounts and assets that you own or have explicit permission to test.

4. **Respect User Privacy**: Do not access, modify, or delete any user data without explicit permission. Respect user privacy and only access data that is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.

5. **Submit Vulnerability**: To report a security vulnerability, please contact us via the [support server](https://discord.gg/KnrQGEbS5k). We encourage you to encrypt your email using our public PGP key to ensure the confidentiality of your communication.

## Our Commitment
